# Welcome to the go-asn1plus contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

First, welcome to the go-asn1plus repository. The goal of the go-asn1plus package is to provide a usable and extensible ITU-T rec. X.680/X.690 implementation -- something that has long since been hard to find in Go.

## Contributor guide

A few things should be reviewed before submitting a contribution to this repository:

 1. Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.
 2. Review ITU-T rec. X.680/X.690 -- The subsets implemented within this package are largely based on these standards.
 3. Review the [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests) document, unless you're already familiar with its concepts ...
 4. Be prepared to provide meaningful unit tests and/or examples for any pull requests; use of AI in this regard is acceptable, provided the tests are not harmful and maintain a fairly high degree of coverage

Once you've accomplished the above items, you're probably ready to start making contributions. For this, I thank you.
